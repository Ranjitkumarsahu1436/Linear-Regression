# Linear-Regression

Linear regression models are used to show or predict the relationship between two variables or factors. The factor that is being predicted (the factor that the equation solves for) is called the dependent variable. The factors that are used to predict the value of the dependent variable are called the independent variables.


In linear regression, each observation consists of two values. One value is for the dependent variable and one value is for the independent variable. In this simple model, a straight line approximates the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variable.


When two or more independent variables are used in regression analysis, the model is no longer a simple linear one. This is known as multiple regression.
The simple linear regression model is represented by:

y = β0 +β1x+ε
